Description: Provides functions for loglikelihood adjustment for fitting extreme value 
    models. The fitted object is from the package 'evd' and 'ismev' for extreme value 
    analysis. The 'chandwich' package 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chandwich/index.html> is used to construct 
    the adjustment given the clustered data. The 'sandwich' package 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sandwich/index.html> is used to adjust the 
    robust covariance matrix estimators.
