\title{oolax: Objected-orientated Loglikelihood Adjustment for Extreme Value Models}
\description{
Performs adjustments of the independence loglikelihood for fitted model
objects produced by several R packages for extreme value modelling.
The packages are \code{evd}, \code{ismev}, ...
}
\details{
The main function in the oolax package is \code{\link{alogLik}}, which provides
loglikelihood adjustment for fitting Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) model and
Threshold Modelling using generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). The adjustment is
based on package \code{\link{evd}}.the adjustment is made on objects that is coming from the
evd package.
